# Welcome to my repository!

This repository contains code for a game called Water sort puzzle, implemented in the C programming language.

## What is the Water sort puzzle?

In the Water sort puzzle, the player is given a number of bottles filled with layers of different colored liquids, and generally one or two empty bottles. The goal of the game is to make all bottles uniformly colored, by taking a bottle full of at least one layer and pouring it into another bottle. The main rules of the game are:

 * You can pour any color in an empty bottle
 * You can only pour a layer on top of another layer if they are the same color
 * The initial state of the game is randomly generated using a BBS (Blum Blum Shub) random generator.
